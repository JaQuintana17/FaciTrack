/**
 * The board shown on a screen outside a Faculty Lounge.
 *
 * A panel in a corridor cannot sign in, so the device is authorised instead of
 * a person: the screen shows a pairing code, an admin approves it and chooses
 * which lounge it belongs to, and only then does it get a board. Until then it
 * shows the code and nothing else.
 *
 * There is no department in the URL. An address like /display/CCS is guessable
 * from anywhere in the world, which is what made the first version of this
 * effectively public; the department now comes from the approval, so there is
 * nothing left to enumerate.
 *
 * What it publishes stays deliberately thin: a name, a position, In or Out,
 * and the availability the instructor set. getFacultyPresence() also returns
 * the detected room and the base office; both are dropped here. Saying which
 * room somebody is sitting in is a different feature from saying whether they
 * are in, and only the second was asked for.
 *
 * The two statuses shown are independent: availability is what the instructor
 * said, presence is what a scanner saw. Neither is inferred from the other.
